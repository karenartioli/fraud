1. How many transactions are not flagged as fraud that are fraud? 
Explain what false negatives are and why they are bad in the context of this analysis.

False negatives are where a test returns a negative value but should have returned a positive value. In this example, there are transactions which were not flagged as fraud but they were actually fraudulent.
This is bad because we let fraudulent customers in.
It's expected to have some error on the model as it won't be 100% accurate, but the lower the number is, the better.

2. For fraudulent transactions, what is the median and average amount by transaction type? 
Explain why these are different.
TRANSFER average=1,480,891.67 median=445,705.76
CASH OUT average=1,455,102.59 median=435,516.91
The dataset is positively skewed due to outliers of large transactions amount (i.e. 287 transactions are 10,000,000 which brings the average up).
Median tends to be less affected by this, which is why it's a significantly lower number and it better represents the central point.

3. Given you answers to **Question 2**, on which type should we focus first if we want to deal with fraudulent transactions. Why?
Transfer and cash out as all fraudulent transactions were in those types.
Also, it wouldn't make sense a fraud transaction putting money into an account, they would just take it out.

4. Is there any origin-destination pair that occurs more than once? If so, is it usually fraudulent? 
Otherwise, what does it mean there are not repeated occurrences?
None. One possible explanation is that this is just a sample of the original database which is probably much bigger.
